Merge : #26
==========================================================

A new library has been created to store all the classes that are used as tools. TRestFFT has been moved to this new module libRestTools.so.

A new tool class TRestMesh has been created to help on definning node relation of a distribution of hits. A node is related to another node if it is found within 1-cell distance from it, then the nodes will be associated to the same group number.

For the moment node association to a group is defined by using 1-cell neighbour. This could be generalized in the future to n-cell neighbourds. Then we may increase cell granularity, and even define spherical node association topology.

A new process TRestFastHitsToTrackProcess has been added. This process uses TRestMesh to find the relation between the hits in order to define the tracks. The process requires to define the net size, net position and cell resolution (or size). See updates in myConfig.rml.

Author : Javier Galan
Merge : #25
==========================================================

Issues #2 and #3 have been solved by this merge.

Changes in TRestMetadata related to config path definition and environmental values interpretation inside a config file.

New method TRestMetadata::ReplaceEnvironmentalVariables used to parse environmental variables inside a config file.

REST now will read configuration files from a path using the following priorities:

1) It will try to find first the configuration file inside REST_CONFIG

2) If it does not find the config file (or REST_CONFIG), it will try to find the config file in the directory where we are launching our executable

3) If still, it does not find the config file it will try to find it at REST_PATH/config.


Added CHANGELOG file. It should contain similar information to the information given when we do a merge request.

==========================================================

TRestMetadata, TRestReadout and TRestRun upgrades
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Issues #18 , #19 and #25 have been solved by the merge.

TRestMetadata
-------------

The FOR loop implementation in config files has been modified. The tag "to" now includes the last value in the iteration.
<for from="1" to="N" step="1" > means it will do 1,2,...,N

TRestRun
--------

fRunIndex has been removed and fParentRunNumber has been implemented.
The run filename is now by default :
Run_experiment_user_processName_Tag_runNumber_parentNumber_codeVersion.root

Modifications related to overwrite option.
Now runNumber accepts option runNumber="auto". It will take by default an increasing value stored in inputData/runNumber.

TRestReadoutModule
------------------

New methods have been implemented

TRestReadoutMapping
-------------------

Solved bug related to mapping of module boundaries.

TRestReadoutPixel
-----------------

Solved bug related to pixel boundaries precision. Now pixel size is increased by a small size delta.
