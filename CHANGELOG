==========================================================

Issues #2 and #3 have been solved by this merge.

Changes in TRestMetadata related to config path definition and environmental values interpretation inside a config file.

New method TRestMetadata::ReplaceEnvironmentalVariables used to parse environmental variables inside a config file.

REST now will read configuration files from a path using the following priorities:

1) It will try to find first the configuration file inside REST_CONFIG

2) If it does not find the config file (or REST_CONFIG), it will try to find the config file in the directory where we are launching our executable

3) If still, it does not find the config file it will try to find it at REST_PATH/config.


Added CHANGELOG file. It should contain similar information to the information given when we do a merge request.

TRestMetadata, TRestReadout and TRestRun upgrades
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Issues #18 , #19 and #25 have been solved by the merge.

TRestMetadata
-------------

The FOR loop implementation in config files has been modified. The tag "to" now includes the last value in the iteration.
<for from="1" to="N" step="1" > means it will do 1,2,...,N

fRunIndex has been removed and fParentRunNumber has been implemented.
The run filename is now by default :
Run_experiment_user_processName_Tag_runNumber_parentNumber_codeVersion.root

Now runNumber accepts option runNumber="auto". It will take by default an increasing value stored in inputData/runNumber.

------------------

New methods have been implemented

TRestReadoutMapping

Solved bug related to mapping of module boundaries.

TRestReadoutPixel
