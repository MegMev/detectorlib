This library is used to define a detector readout topology, and access gas or other detector properties. It also implements processes including routines for event reconstruction from real detector data, and/or emulation of different physical response effects, such as electron diffusion, smearing, or basic spatial transformations.

Please have a look to this library [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before pushing changes to this repository.
