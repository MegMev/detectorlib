Distribution description

- Gamma_cosmic: three distributions (all of them normalized) corresponding to gammas at sea level (from tables in "Cosmic Rays at Earth" by Grieder (Ed. Elsevier)). Flux data from the same book and also from a comparative integral
	-LE gamma distribution : from 1 to 10 MeV-->bin size is 100 keV
        (LE Flux ~ 8E-3 gammas/cm2 s sr, same for e and e+)
        -ME gamma distribution:   from 10 to 100 MeV-->bin size is 100 keV
         (ME Flux ~ 4E-3 gammas/cm2 s sr, same for e and e+)
        -HE gamma distribution :  from 0.1 GeV to 100 GeV --> bin size is 0.1 GeV
  	(HE Flux ~ 1E-3 gammas/cm2 s sr, same for e and e+)
       Electrons and positron should follow the similar energy distributions

- Muons : two distributions (normalized) corresponding to Sea level and Canfranc underground site muons (from tables in "Cosmic Rays at Earth" by Grieder (Ed. Elsevier)) 
	-cosmic muons (sea level) from 0.2 to 85 GeV --> bin size is 1 MeV
	(Sea level Flux ~ 125 muons/m2 s)
	-LSC muons from 1 to 4250 GeV --> bin size 100 MeV
         (LSC Flux ~ 5E-3 muons/m2 s)
- Cosmic Neutrons: two normalized distributions following Ziegler formula in IBM Journal of Research and Development, Volume 40, Issue 1, pp. 19-39 (1996)
	-Cosmic Neutrons (Medium energies): from 10 to 1000 MeV --> bin size is 1 MeV   
	(Flux ~ values from 44 to 82 n/m2 s from different measurements, ~a few  1E-3 n/cm2 s)
	-HE Cosmic Neutrons: from 1 to 10 GeV --> bin size is 0.01 GeV
 	(Flux ~ 0.1 n/m2 s infered from Ziegler)

- Radiactivity Neutrons : normalized distribution of the "Evaporation" spectra from 0 to 10 GeV --> bin size is 0.01 GeV
	(LSC Flux ~ 3.82E-2 neutrons/m2 s)
