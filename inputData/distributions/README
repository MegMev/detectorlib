File : CosmicGammas.root
Histograms : hLEgamma, hMEgamma, hHEgamma

Description : It contains three distributions (all of them normalized) corresponding to gammas at sea level (from tables in "Cosmic Rays at Earth" by Grieder (Ed. Elsevier)). Flux data from the same book and also from a comparative integral.

  - hLEgamma : Low energy gammas distribution. From 1 to 10 MeV (bin size 100 keV).
               Flux : 8e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

  - hMEgamma : Medium energy gammas distribution. From 10 to 100 MeV (bin size 100 keV).
               Flux : 4e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

  - hHEgamma : Medium energy gammas distribution. From 0.1 to 100 GeV (bin size 100 MeV).
               Flux : 1e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

Notes :
    - Electrons (e-) and positrons (e+) should follow similar distributions.
    - It is assumed that angular distributions should go with Cos^2.
      The angular distribution can be found in file "CosmicAngles.root" and histogram "Theta2".

File : CosmicNeutrons.root
Histograms : CosmicNeutrons, HECosmicNeutrons

Description: it contains two normalized distributions following Ziegler formula in IBM Journal of Research and Development, Volume 40, Issue 1, pp. 19-39 (1996) for medium and high energy cosmic neutrons

    - CosmicNeutrons: Medium energies from 10 to 1000 MeV --> bin size is 1 MeV
	             Flux: values from 44 to 82 n/m2 s from different measurements, ~a few  1E-3 n/cm2 s

    - HECosmicNeutrons: from 1 to 10 GeV --> bin size is 0.01 GeV
                 Flux: ~0.1 n/m2 s infered from Ziegler)

Notes:
    - It is assumed that angular distributions should go with Cos^2
      This distribution can be found in file "CosmicAngles.root" and histograms Theta, Theta2, Theta3.

File : Muons.root
Histograms : cosmicmuon, LSCmuon, CJULmuon

    -cosmicmuons : Sea Level from 0.2 to 328 GeV --> bin size is 1 MeV
		   Flux: ~ 125 muons/m2 s 
		   angular distributions: Cos2\theta

File : RadioactivityNeutrons.root
Histograms : EvaporationNeutrons

Description: it contains a normalized distribution of the neutrons coming form radioactivity of nearby materials and walls

    - EvaporationNeutrons: "Evaporation" spectra from 0 to 10 GeV --> bin size is 0.01 GeV
		     LSC Flux ~ 3.82E-2 neutrons/m2 s
		     The angle should be isotropic

File : RadioactivityGammas.root
Histograms : Th232, U238, ThetaAngle

Description : Full chain decay simulation of Th232 and U238 launched uniformly inside a concrete wall. Then the gammas coming out the wall are counted and its energy filled inside the histograms Th232 and U238. 

    - Th232 : Gamma energy spectrum resulting from Th232 decay chain (Energy units in keV).

    - U238 : Gamma energy spectrum resulting from U238 decay chain (Energy units in keV).

    - ThetaAngle : Resulting angular distribution from the gamma flux. Theta=0 is the direction normal to the surface.

Notes : 
    - The total number of counts inside the energy distributions corresponds to a simulation of 20M events in a concrete mass of 17664 tonnes.
    - The phi angular distribution is uniform.

File : CosmicAngles.root
Histograms : Theta, Theta2, Theta3

Description: It contains three angular distributions for cosmics arriving from zenit.

    - Theta    :  following a Cos(theta) distribution

    - Theta2   :  following a Cos^2(theta) distribution

    - Theta3   :  following a Cos^3(theta) distribution
