File : CosmicGammas.root
Histograms : hLEgamma, hMEgamma, hHEgamma

Description : It contains three distributions (all of them normalized) corresponding to gammas at sea level (from tables in "Cosmic Rays at Earth" by Grieder (Ed. Elsevier)). Flux data from the same book and also from a comparative integral.

  - hLEgamma : Low energy gammas distribution. From 1 to 10 MeV (bin size 100 keV).
               Flux : 8e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

  - hMEgamma : Medium energy gammas distribution. From 10 to 100 MeV (bin size 100 keV).
               Flux : 4e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

  - hHEgamma : Medium energy gammas distribution. From 0.1 to 100 GeV (bin size 100 MeV).
               Flux : 1e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

Note : Electrons (e-) and positrons (e+) should follow similar distributions.


It is assumed that angular distributions should go with Cos2\theta 

This distribution can be found in file "CosineAngle.root" and histogram "Cos2Theta"

File : CosmicNeutrons.root
Histograms : CosmicNeutrons, HECosmicNeutrons

Description: it contains two normalized distributions following Ziegler formula in IBM Journal of Research and Development, Volume 40, Issue 1, pp. 19-39 (1996) for medium and high energy cosmic neutrons

    -CosmicNeutrons: Medium energies from 10 to 1000 MeV --> bin size is 1 MeV   
	             Flux: values from 44 to 82 n/m2 s from different measurements, ~a few  1E-3 n/cm2 s

    -HECosmicNeutrons:from 1 to 10 GeV --> bin size is 0.01 GeV
 	             Flux: ~ 0.1 n/m2 s infered from Ziegler)

It is assumed that angular distributions should go with Cos2\theta 

This distribution can be found in file "hVerticalAngle.root" and histograms "Cos2Theta" os "Cos3Theta"
