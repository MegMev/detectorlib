Hi
    
    steps to install root, geant4, garfied and REST_v2
    1. Go to the parent folder of REST_v2.

    2. If you are using Ubuntu, use `./install_requried_softwares_Ubuntu.sh' 
       to install requried softwares. If your are working on a cluster, these
       softwares should have been installed, so you can skip this step.
    
    3. Use `./REST_v2/install/make_geant4.sh' to build geant4
    
    4. Use `./REST_v2/install/make_root.sh' to build ROOT framework
   
    5. Use `./REST_v2/install/make_garfield.sh' to build garfield
    
    6. Add `source path/to/REST_v2/install/REST_ENV.sh' into `~/.bashrc'
       to enable geant4, ROOT, garfield and REST.
    
    7. You can go to any folder, Use `path/to/make_RESTv2.sh' to build REST

    8. You can copy `REST_v2/install/.rootrc' to `~/.rootrc' to load REST_v2
       scripts while starting the root.
    
    If you skip any step from 2 to 5, if you want to use your own installation.
