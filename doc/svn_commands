If there is a conflict an we postpone we can solve the conflit in the working copy.
To solve the conflict we must do

svn resolve --accept working test.txt

svn update --revision XX

Or checkout a specific version in a new directory

mkdir revision_XX
cd revision_XX
svn co http://sultan.unizar.es@XX
